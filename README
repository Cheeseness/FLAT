1. INTRODUCTION
===============

Hey and thanks for trying our testbuild for FLAT!

FLAT was created by Johan "SteelRaven7" Hassel, Josh "Cheeseness" Bush, Johannes "jo_shadow" Peter and Anton Riehl for the 7 Day FPS Challenge 2012.

Inspired by early first person shooters, arcade genres and popular sci-fi, we aimed to create a unique and hopefully memorable gameplay experience.

In the several days following the conclusion of the 7 Day FPS Challenge, we spent time polishing numerous gameplay aspects and adding additional audio to the game. At this stage, we still consider it a work in progress, but we believe that it is enjoyable and playable in its current state.

Thanks again, and don't hesitate to leave feedback if you feel like it!

2. STORY
========

You play as the last remaining individual of a race who has fallen under the mind control of the evil Pulse Dragon. Marooned on a crystaline world, you must fight your way through hordes of your own kind to slay the mighty Pulse Dragon and free your people.

(Seriously, we didn't have a lot of time to flesh out story <3)



2. CONTROLS
===========

Look around using the mouse, or the arrow keys.

Hold W and alternate between A/D to move forward (think ice-skating!).
Holding S allows you to accelerate backwards in the same manner.
When you have gained sufficient speed, you can "carve" or slide left/right by holding down A or D for longer periods.

Holding A or D and pressing space allows you to jump and dodge projectiles.

You can pick up new weapons and health kits from supply capsules. They play a sound when they spawn, so keep an eye out for the white beam that indicates one. Pressing H or Q will use a health kit.

Use the left mouse button, X or the Up key to shoot.

The escape key will pause the game.

* Sometimes, on rare occasions, the camera will spin wildly at the start of the game on MacOS
* There are invisible crystals that the player can bump into
